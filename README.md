# Error-Performance-of-QPSK-using-MATLAB
1. Generate a string of message bits.
2. Encode using QPSK with energy per symbol Es and represent it using points in a signal-space.
3. Simulate transmission of the QPSK modulated signal via an AWGN channel with variance N0/2 in both I-channel and Q-channel.
4. Detect using an ML decoder and plot the probability of error as a function of SNR per bit Eb/N0 where Es = 2Eb.
